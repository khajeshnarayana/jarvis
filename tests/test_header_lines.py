"""Everything variable that lands ABOVE the untrusted block.

`_wrap_untrusted` protects what is inside it. The header line above it is
read by the brain as JARVIS's own words, so every value interpolated there
is a place somebody else can put a sentence in JARVIS's mouth. The previous
round moved `title`, `last_prompt` and `last_text` inside the block and
stopped — the fields on the lines immediately above them stayed raw:

    session.needs        `_phrase_needs` returns f"waiting on {reason}"
                         for a reason it does not recognise
    session.state        `_STATE_WORDS.get(state, state)` falls back to the
                         roster's own string
    session.recent_tools `str(block["name"])` out of a transcript, and the
                         only one of its four siblings with no `_clip`
    session.voice_name   raw in `_needs_you_summary`, which is the one part
                         of `list_sessions` that is NOT inside a block

A `</session-output>` in `waitingFor` closes the wrapper and everything
after it reads as JARVIS's own words. Confirmed.

So this file does not test the two fields that were missed. It tests the
CLASS: every attacker-controlled attribute a session has, enumerated from
`session_watch.SessionState` itself, driven through every path that prints
one outside a block. A field added to that dataclass next year fails here
until somebody decides where it goes.

The second half is the sanitisers themselves. `_plain_name` used
`re.match(r"^…$")`, and Python's `$` matches before a trailing newline, so
`_plain_name("ok\\n")` returned `'ok\\n'` — a newline is a whole line of
forged JARVIS. Every anchored regex in server.py has the same shape, so the
test is over all of them, found in the source rather than listed here.

# --- THE CLASS: every function in the CODEBASE that prints a foreign field --
#
# Three rounds of this test found nothing, and the reason was the same all
# three times: THE UNIVERSE WAS ONE FILE AND ONE ACCESS SHAPE.
#
#   * it parsed `server.py` only — and the worst finding of the fourth audit
#     is in `brain.py`, where a roster project name was spliced raw into
#     `--append-system-prompt`, trusted text in every generation;
#   * its read predicate was `ast.Attribute` — `s.voice_name` — and
#     `_announce_needs_you` reads `s.get("voice_name")` out of a dict, so the
#     one URGENT interrupt in the file was invisible to it;
#   * its field set was `SessionState` — and a run row's `project_name`,
#     which reaches the same headers and the same spoken lines, was not in it.
#
# So the universe is now written down, and it is:
#
#   MODULES  every `*.py` at the top level of the repository. Not `server.py`,
#            not a list of names — the glob.
#   FIELDS   every field of `session_watch.SessionState`, UNION every TEXT
#            column of the `runs` table, both read out of the source rather
#            than typed here.
#   SHAPES   every way Python reads a field off a foreign object:
#            `x.field` (attribute), `x["field"]` (subscript with a string
#            key), and `x.get("field")` — the shape that hid finding 4.
#   PRINTS   the function builds text: an f-string, a `.join`, a `-> str`
#            return, or `+ "a literal"` (the shape `launch_prompt` uses).
#
# Every function in that class is DRIVEN below with a hostile value, or
# carries a written reason for being exempt. Keys are `module.function`,
# because four of the names collide across modules.
